# Piekielna Rezolucja 3

In the mystical city of Wroclaw, where the cobblestone streets echoed with the whispers of academia, the Institute of Computer Science stood as a beacon of intellectual prowess. Among the esteemed scholars, one figure shone brightly - Jerzy, known to his peers and students as the revered Professor Marcinkowski. His classes were a realm of profound insights, yet only a privileged few could fathom the depths of his teachings.

On a frosty Monday morning, Professor Marcinkowski, affectionately addressed as JMa, embarked on his routine journey to deliver a lecture on Advanced Logic for Computer Scientists. This course, loved by some and feared by many, was a crucible of intellectual challenge. Immersed in contemplation, JMa delved into the intricacies of his upcoming lecture, oblivious to the extraordinary turn his day was about to take.

Suddenly, the pavement before him, as if responding to an unseen force, opened up with seismic force, leaving JMa with no recourse but to tumble into an abyss of unfathomable depth — an otherworldly descent into what could only be described as Hell itself.

To rescue Professor Marcinkowski and ensure the continuity of logical wisdom, you, an inexperienced logician, find yourself tasked with confronting a challenge forged in the deepest recesses of Hell. Your mission is clear: prove the contradictory of a set of propositional clauses using the resolution rule or present a valuation that satisfies the set.

The urgency is palpable, for the Devil is an impatient creature. His malevolent demons, serving as guardians of JMa in the heart of Hell, set a daunting constraint—limited time and space on your paper to achieve success. The consequences of failure are dire; Professor Marcinkowski will be consigned to eternal damnation, and his students left bereft of their guiding logician.

A successful resolution, however, holds the promise of liberation. The Devil, recognizing your triumph, will release Professor Marcinkowski from the clutches of Hell. In gratitude, Proffessor extends a unique opportunity — a chance to become the esteemed logician's pupil and receive a transformative boost in intellectual capabilities.

The fate of Marcinkowski, the safety of logic, and the coveted opportunity to become a prodigy's pupil now rest on your shoulders. The journey into the abyss of logic and the supernatural awaits your determined intellect.
