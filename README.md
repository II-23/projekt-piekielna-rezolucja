# Piekielna Rezolucja 3

In the beautiful city of Wroclaw, in the Institute of Computer Science, there was a brilliant logician. By his colleagues known as Jerzy. By his students known as prof. Marcinkowski. He taught a lot, yet only few understood what they were taught about.
On one sunny, freezing Monday, JMa was driving to work to carry out a lecture of Advanced Logic for Computer Scientists - a course feared by many and by some - loved. As usual, he got burried in his thoughts, inventing a plan for the lecture which was about to happen in 15 minutes.
Suddenly, the road before him opened, as if an immense erthquake had just occured, and prof Marcinkowski - unable to stop his car in time - fell into the unmeasurably deep hole - the Hell itself.

To safe Marcinkowski and the future of logic, you, an inexperienced logician has to stand up to the challenged forged in the deepest of Hell - proove that a set of propositional clauses is contradictory via resolution rule, or show a valuation which satisfies the set.

Since the Devil is an impatient creature, he shan't wait for you indefinitely. His Deamons, which guard Marcinkowski in the heart of hell are bloodthirsty. You only have a set amount of time and space on your piece of paper to succeed. Should you not be able to, the prof Marcinkowski will be held in the Hell forever and a bunch of his students will forever remain without their logic master. If you the prof Marcinkowski will be set free by the Devil. To express his gratitude to his saviour, he will grant such an individual a chance to become his pupil and boost in his genius
